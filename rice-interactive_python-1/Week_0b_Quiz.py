3. Question 3
In the following code, there is one line starting with #. What does this line mean to Python?

tax_rate = 0.15

This text is used as a file name for the code.
This is a comment aimed at the human reader. Python ignores such comments.
This is a syntax error.

4. Question 4
Which of the following arithmetic expressions are syntactically correct?
Try each of them in CodeSkulptor.

5 * 3 (7 - 2)
3 * ((2 - 9) + 4)) * (2 + (1 - 3))
(8 + (1 + (2 * 4) - 3))
(7 - 2) / (3 ** 2)
5 - 1 - 3 - 7 - 0

5. Question 5
You would like to make it so that the variable ounces has the value 16, thus representing one pound. What simple Python statement will accomplish this?

ounces := 16
ounces == 16
16 = ounces
ounces = 16

6. Question 6
A gram is equal to 0.035274 ounces. Assume that the variable mass_in_ounces has a value representing a given mass in ounces. Which Python statement below uses the variable mass_in_ounces to compute an equivalent mass mass_in_grams expressed in grams?

Think about it mathematically, but also test these expressions in CodeSkulptor3. If you are still confused, you might check out this student tutorial video by Kelly on unit conversions.

mass_in_grams = mass_in_ounces * 0.035274
mass_in_ounces = 0.035274 * mass_in_grams
mass_in_grams = 0.035274 / mass_in_ounces
mass_in_grams = mass_in_ounces / 0.035274

7. Question 7
Which of the following can be used as a variable name?
Try using each in CodeSkulptor.

MYnumber
16ounces
my-number
number123

8. Question 8
Assume you have values in the variables x and y. Which statement(s) would result in x having the sum of the current values of x and y?
Test your answer in CodeSkulptor.

x = x + y
y += x+y
x = y + x
y += x
